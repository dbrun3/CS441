# CS441 - Dylan Brunelle

My 441 repo. 

HW1 is in the 'hw1' branch. To try it yourself, clone the repository and open in in Intellij. Make sure to set your JDK to 8,
since that's what I used. You could probably go higher, but I know for a fact 23 is incompatible.
Run the driver program which takes "operation" "input" "output" args. Operations are "Word2Vec" "CosineSim" and "Tokenization"
